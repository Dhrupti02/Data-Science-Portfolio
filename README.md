# Data-Science-Portfolio
The repository contains data science projects I've done while learning and a little introduction to each topic covered in data science.

So the very first question people ask is what is data science? Here is a brief introduction to data science that will help to interpret what data science is.

**What is data science?**

There is no perfect definition for data science. Data science is getting insights from real-world data using
some data science tools and techniques. People often describe data science as statistics and machine learning 
while, in reality, it is not just statistics and machine learning. The famous Drew Conway’s Venn diagram of
data science describes the term data science as,

- Hacking skills here are not the computer or IP hacking. It’s data hacking. In a real-time scenario, we do not always get the excelled data. Sometimes we need live data, sometimes we need sentenced data, and sometimes we need to collect data from the web. To convert this kind of raw data into excel or CSV, we need to scrap the data from the web, which is web scraping. Web scraping is the technique used to get data from different web applications and convert them into excel or CSV data. Apart from that, even the gathered data sometimes looks messy and chaotic. Anyone can visualize the bar graphs and show some statistics with simple datasets. But the one with the hacking skills can convert chaos into insights.
- We can’t do data science without mathematics. The math here includes probability, linear algebra, and statistics.
- Substantive expertise can be considered exceptional domain knowledge. Domain experts are great question askers. For instance, social media companies provide recommendations to the user by analyzing their behavior. For doing so, they will seek help from social scientists. Social scientists are experts in examining human behaviors based on their likes, comments, and posts. They can ask more valuable and meaningful questions to get insights.
- Machine learning is a crucial part of data science. Hence, From getting meaningful data to making predictive models from those data, machine learning techniques and algorithms play an essential role.

This repository contains practical solutions to Data analysis, end-to-end data science projects, machine learning algorithms, time-series analysis, and NLP.
